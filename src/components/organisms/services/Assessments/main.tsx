          A Viability Assessment is necessary when alternative care arrangements

          Work will also be undertaken with the children. The nature and extent
          of this work will be dependant upon the children’s’ ages and level of
          understanding. It is also likely to include time spent without either
          of the children’s parents present and if it is agreed and appropriate
          time spent with their non resident parent. My Life and Me is a tool
          that we often use which provides a much-needed template to help
          children separated from their family of origin develop and record an
          accurate knowledge of their past and their family. Once completed, the
          book will provide them with a permanent record which they, and the

          can carry with them through life. This comprehensive workbook can be
          used flexibly by any child, including children with special needs and
          children adopted from abroad. Colour coded sections include space for
          drawings, photographs, documents and a record of feelings and thoughts

          A Core Assessment is an in-depth assessment carried out by a Local

          A Child Permanence Report is a requirement of the Adoption Agencies
          Regulations 2005. It is the document that is presented to an
          Adoption/Fostering panel to enable a decision to be made about whether
          it is in a child’s best interests to be placed for adoption or with
          long term foster carers. Adopters, foster carers, fostering Social
          Workers and children rely on Child Permanence Report’s to provide them
          with detailed and accurate information about a child’s life history
          and the reasons why a child has not been able to remain in their birth
          family. Project West assessors will gather information from Local
          Authority case files, the allocated Social Worker and foster carers,
          wider family and expert assessments. Where appropriate a fostering
          Social Worker will meet with the child to ascertain their wishes and
          feelings and the child’s parents. Project West endeavours to ensure
          all the relevant people have an opportunity to contribute to the Child
          Permanence Report and to work sensitively with all those involved.

          These assessments are frequently used when little is known about a
          potential placement option but quick (but informed) decisions need to
          be taken.

        <p className={" text-gray-500 font-light text-sm mt-2"}>
          In our experience where these types of assessment are carried out,
          they almost invariably save significant time, money and energy in case
          management, prevent wishful thinking overtaking reality and in the
          process considerably reduce delay in progressing a case.

        <p>
          These assessments are often requested where you have a situation which
          requires distinct but inter-related assessment involving one or more
          children and / or adults. For example the situation may require a Core
          Assessment of the birth parent (s), whilst simultaneously requiring a
          Kinship Assessment in respect of a potential family placement option
          in another part of the family, whilst a discrete Contact Assessment is
          needed in respect of another part of the family.

          Whilst these assessments by their nature tend to be somewhat larger
          undertakings than most other assessments, they do tend to be favoured
          by families local authorities and the courts, not least because they
          help provide a consistent and well informed approach towards all of
          the assessment work which needs to be carried out.
